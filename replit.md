# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

### Pages
- `/` - Landing page with hero, categories, testimonials, and blog sections
- `/products` - Product catalog with search and filtering
- `/products/[id]` - Individual product details
- `/login` - Authentication page
- `/admin` - Protected admin dashboard
- `/dashboard` - Protected user dashboard
- `/checkout` - Order checkout flow (with buy/rent selection)

### Components
- `Header.tsx` - Sticky navigation with language selector
- `Footer.tsx` - Site footer with links and social media
- `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Admin panel interface
- `UserDashboard.tsx` - Customer portal interface

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 4 for utility-first styling
- Custom orange/black/white color scheme
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Hover states and transitions for interactive elements

## Backend Architecture

### API Routes
- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/products` - Product CRUD operations (GET, POST)
- `/api/products/[id]` - Individual product operations (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- `/api/categories` - Category management (GET, POST)
- `/api/orders` - Order management (GET, POST)

### Database Models

**Product Model**
- name, brand, category, price, rentalPrice
- model, condition, year, image, images
- description, weight, specifications
- available, featured (boolean flags)
- timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

**User Model**
- name, email, password (hashed)
- phone, role (admin/user), address
- timestamps

**Category Model**
- name, slug, description, image
- timestamps

**Order Model**
- user (reference to User)
- items (array of products with type: buy/rent)
- totalAmount, status, paymentMethod, paymentStatus
- shippingAddress (embedded object)
- timestamps

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials to `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`
2. NextAuth validates against MongoDB User collection
3. JWT token generated with user ID and role
4. Middleware protects routes based on authentication status
5. Admin routes check for 'admin' role in JWT

## Data Layer

### MongoDB Connection
- Connection pooling with mongoose
- Environment variable: `MONGODB_URI`
- Automatic reconnection on failure
- Cached connection for serverless optimization

### Database Seeding
- Script: `scripts/seed.ts`
- Run with: `npm run seed`
- Populates initial:
  - Categories from lib/data.json
  - Products with pricing and rental options
  - Default admin user (admin@heavyquips.com / admin123)

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
AUTH_SECRET=<random-secret-key-for-jwt>
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Design Patterns

### Server Components
- Pages use React Server Components by default
- Data fetching on the server for better performance
- Reduced client-side JavaScript

### Client Components
- Interactive components marked with 'use client'
- State management with React hooks
- Form handling and user interactions

### API Security
- Protected routes check authentication status
- Admin operations verify admin role
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
